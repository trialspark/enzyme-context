# enzyme-context (v1.1.0)

- Change enzyme-context's `mount()` and `shallow()` functions to return a `ReactWrapper` and `ShallowWrapper` instead of an object.

To maintain backwards-compatibility with previous versions of enzyme-context a `component` attribute is also attached to the wrapper that just references itself.
