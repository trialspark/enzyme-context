# enzyme-context (vNext)

- Change enzyme-context's `mount()` and `shallow()` functions to return a `ReactWrapper` and `ShallowWrapper` instead of an object. Plugin controllers are then attached directly to the returned Enzyme wrapper. To maintain backwards-compatibility with previous versions of enzyme-context a `component` attribute is also attached to the wrapper that just references itself.
